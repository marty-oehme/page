> Cleaning my digital shelves I found this old draft from half a decade ago of me being annoyed in a public library. Re-reading it I actually find it still speaks to me in a somewhat naive way, so here it is published.

I am sitting in the library, writing down some of my own thoughts on a few articles I have recently read. Opposite me sits a girl writing a paper for her university degree. In front of her is her black HP laptop, sprawled around her table are various notes, text fragments, some pages with scribbles on them and a bottle of water. She is variously deep in thought reading excerpts from her annotated notes and quickly switching back to her laptop to get her ideas out of her mind and onto her paper. Suddenly however, there is a loud buzzing sound and her eyes jump up. Up from the page, up from the notes, up and out of her thoughts. ~~ZZZZTT~~

I jump as well. But I know what the sound is. I have been sitting opposite her for about an hour now, switching, just like her, lost deep in thought and perusing my annotations on the articles. At first I was confused, why would she willingly endure such startling noises next to her. She must know how alarmed she looks the instant that buzz rings in both our heads. She must notice how much it pulls our attention toward that spot on the table. That little white buzzing square, capturing our stares. ~~ZZZZTT~~

When it first buzzed, I was confused. When it buzzed a second time, I knew what it was. I thought she must have forgotten to turn it quiet, or to move it from the table. When it buzzed a third time, I began to be annoyed. Why would she keep it there, buzzing along to our annoyance? But she did not seem annoyed, nor does she now. She seems startled, and confused for a second, every time the sound pipes up again. But she also seems interested, faintly, in what news that little buzz brings to her eyes. ~~ZZZZTT~~

The news seem hardly worthy of her attention. Rarely does she pay the square on her table more than a glance. Every now and again she picks it up, once she even smirked at those news. At first I thought she would put it away somewhere else, now that she even picked it up. But she didn't. She put it back where it was just a second ago and tried concentrating on her notes again. I realize now, why would she put it somewhere else when it does not annoy her? And anyways, it does not occupy her too much. Not even three seconds have gone by, from the noise to the square being planted firmly on the table again. ~~ZZZZTT~~

But wait she picked it up again. And this time there was not even a buzz to be heard. Or was there? It does not matter. She put it down again. When I got over my annoyance, I began to be intrigued. How could she stomach being so alarmed every few minutes? She must be waiting for important news. But those news she got. They don't seem too important to her. She must be waiting for the right ones. ~~ZZZZTT~~

Which ones is she waiting for? I hope it isn't too serious. I hope her family and friends are alright. She does not seem concerned. That is good. In fact, she seems content. Or is she just relieved? It is in her hand more than before now. It seems as if the news got more important. They got more plentiful. It buzzed so often. In the last minutes it buzzed over five times. And even if it didnâ€™t she had it in her hand. She is packing her things now. She leaves. Left behind lies a single page of her notes.

~~ZZZZTT~~

Anyway, now, where was I?
