This article analyses the daily package repository statistics files,
colloquially known as ‘popcorn’ files, that are generated by the Void
Linux tool
[`PopCorn`](https://voidlinux.org/packages/?arch=x86_64&q=popcorn) and
uploaded by users who have opted to share with it.

The tool collects a variety of statistics from the user which it
anonymizes (you only get a uuid and to ensure your stats are only
uploaded once, and that’s it) and mixes with all other daily uploaded
statistics on the server. The result is an overview of the package and
kernel ecosystem of the Void Linux distribution collected from a
multitude of unique installations.

Before we get into the pretty graphs I would like to point out that you
too can participate in this collection, and thereby help the
distribution maintainers know which packages are more relevant or,
perhaps equally important, less relevant for end users.

To upload your own statistics anonymously, simply `xbps-install PopCorn`
and enable its service to run in the background with
`ln -s /etc/sv/popcorn /var/service`.

If you only want to grab the data or directly look at the notebook files
underlying this article, take a look at the section [Code and
data](#the-code-and-the-data) at the end of the Appendix.

## Daily statistics file size

Before we take an in-depth look at the packages, let’s quickly get an
overview of the stats files themselves. These are the raw `JSON` files
that we are using throughout the rest of the article, reporting
installed packages and kernels, and their respective versions.

A look at the overall file size for each of the daily statistics files
over time reveals not necessarily changes in the absolute use of
packages (e.g. `rsync` being installed more or less often). Whether it
has been downloaded once or 100 times, the file size does not change
a lot. Instead it increases much more drastically when both
`rsync` and `rclone` are installed, or a variety of different versions
for one of the packages are installed. Similarly for different versions
of the kernel.

An increase in file size here mainly suggests an increase in the
‘breadth’ of files on offer in the repository, whether that be a *wider
variety* of packages or more different package *versions* that people
are interested in, and that the community chooses to use.

So while the overall amount of packages and installations — we’ll get to
those — gives a general estimate of the interest in the distribution, we
see at a glance a more ‘user-choice’-aligned view of how many aisles the
buffet offers, and how many of those the users are eating from.

<div id="fig-filesize">


import filesize from "./plot_json/plot01_fig_filesize.json";

<Plot id="fig-filesize" spec={filesize} />

Figure 1

</div>

As we can see, the difference over time is massive. Especially early on,
between 2019 and the start of 2021, the amount of different packages and
package versions used grew rapidly, with the pace also picking up once
again starting 2023.

From a reported filesize of around 50KB in the first days before the end
of 2019 we have easily tripled the filesize to over 150KB needed for the
report per day. Nowadays we have reached just about 400KB daily report
size, over 8 times the size beginning 2018.

There are a few outlier days with a size of 0 KB on the server, which we
had to remove from the data. In all likelihood, those days were not
reported correctly or there was some kind of issue on the backend so the
stats for those days are lost.

We take a look at the missing days among other things at the end of this
article.

There are also a few days where the modification date of the file does
not correspond to the represented statistical date but those are kept.
This rather points to certain times when the files have been moved on
the backend, recreated externally, or otherwise externally modified but
does not mean the data contained are bad.

Let’s not over-emphasize the results here: it is a very coarse view on
the packages and kernels underneath. Still, the shape of the curve above
is a good indication for what awaits us in other stats: 2019 to 2021
were massive years of growth with some slow-down in 2021. From 2022
onwards the growth picks back up again, if at a more mellow pace.

## Package statistics

Now that we have an idea of how the overall reported sizes in the
distribution have changed over time, let’s focus on the actual package
statistics.

The popcorn files contain two pieces of information we’re interested in:
the number of installs per package (e.g. how many people have `rsync`
installed) and the number of unique installs (i.e. how many people
provide their statistics). We will look at both of these in turn.

<div id="fig-weekly-packages">


import weekly_packages from "./plot_json/plot02_fig_weekly_packages.json";

<Plot id="fig-weekly_packages" spec={weekly_packages} />

Figure 2

</div>

The number of packages installed overall strongly rises until early
2021, when it stagnates a little before rising more slowly again
afterwards. The pattern strongly mirrors the curve we saw before for the
daily filesize. There is a curious dip visible in the data in early 2021
which seems to say fewer packages were installed during most of 2022
compared to 2021.

The graph above traces the *absolute* number of package installations
for each week during the data collection period. That means, a simple
sum of the number of all currently installed packages for each day.

So to figure out one possible reason for the dip, let’s turn to the
daily unique uploads, in we can see a similar pattern, though even more
strongly pronounced.

<div id="fig-unique-installs">


import unique_installs from "./plot_json/plot03_fig_unique_installs.json";

<Plot id="fig-unique_installs" spec={unique_installs} />

Figure 3

</div>

This graphs similarly shows the *absolute* number, this time of unique
Void Linux installations counted for each day. Of course, these are only
the *reported* installations (since we don’t know about unreported), as
can be seen in the overall small number of between 100 and 120
installations.

Unique installations rise sharply until early 2020. Then they not just
stagnate but shrink for the next three years. It is only from early 2023
onwards when the numbers recover and begin rising again slowly.

We also have one day on 05 July 2024 which has *significantly* fewer
unique uploads (36 only, seen in
<a href="#fig-unique-installs" class="quarto-xref">Figure 3</a> averaged
out over a week to about 70) than all the other days around it. While
the weekly averaging of the graph lessens this dip visibly, it would
look even more egregious on a daily accumulation. I do not know if
something happened to data collection or everybody collectively decided
to leave their PC offline just for that day, but the numbers are back to
normal the day after.[^1]

This curve also goes some way to explaining the dip in overall package
installations previously. When there are fewer people uploading their
daily statistics the absolute number of package installations will be
somewhat reduced as a result, unless for some reason the remaining
people all of a sudden start having many more packages installed.

So this could be one reason for the dip in reported package ownership.
The decrease in daily reports maps relatively cleanly onto the dip in
absolute packages, and makes sense from a conceptual standpoint: fewer
reports mean fewer overall reported packages.

Next, let’s verify that hunch by actually looking at the installed
packages *per user* for each day.

<div id="fig-packages-relative">


import packages_relative from "./plot_json/plot04_fig_packages_relative.json";

<Plot id="fig-packages_relative" spec={packages_relative} />

Figure 4

</div>

Combining both previous stats to look at the installed packages at a
more individual level per user, I think we see our hunch confirmed.
There is no similarly strong dip for the relative package ownership as
there was for the absolute package numbers.

Indeed, with the exception of a small more rapid increase in individual
package ownership in 2019, we see a much more stable increase in
per-user packages than the absolute numbers and no similarly big slump
over three years.

Instead different patterns of rises and dips become visible. Both in the
beginning of 2020, and the beginning of 2024, we can see first a strong
rise and then an equally strong fall in the average number of user-owned
packages at once. This could point to one of multiple options:

Perhaps users have been collectively trying out more new packages over
the end of year holidays or with the start of the new year. New year,
new workflow could presumably be something a few users decide to do, and
this may be a reflection of it. Or, similarly, using the new year to
learn new software. The subsequent dip would then mean an end to the
period of trying out new stuff, or adopting the new packages and
dropping the old ones.

At the same time, with the relatively limited absolute number of
installations, it is also quite likely that the representation is skewed
by a single user or a couple users having a much larger package
ownership than everybody else. This may signify new users checking out
Void Linux and downloading a large variety of packages in the process.

Perhaps a similar pattern is visible in the higher number of packages
per user in 2019. With even fewer unique daily reports (between 20 and
60 for the year), single users’ package count differences reflect much
more drastically on this graph. So, one possibility for the rapid
decrease followed by a more linear increase is the ‘balancing’ of
package ownerships across the (wider) reported community.

Want to know how many packages you currently have installed? Find out
with a quick `xbps-query -m | wc -l` to count all your explicitly
installed packages. I currently have 234, so I’m below average for this
cohort (I am much more like an average 2021 Void Linux user, it would
appear).

For an additional breakdown of the absolute numbers of packages on
systems by weekday and month of the year instead of over time, have a
look at
<a href="#fig-weekday-packages" class="quarto-xref">Figure 10</a> and
<a href="#fig-month-packages" class="quarto-xref">Figure 11</a> in the
Appendix below.

An interesting trend is visible toward the end of the timeline window,
with a rapid decline in package numbers per user starting in the summer
of 2025. It is too early for me to clearly see if this is just
variability or an actual trend in the data, but it is a remarkable
change nonetheless.

Beyond pure installation numbers, let’s also take a look at the actual
packages which take the top spots on users’ systems.

<div id="fig-top-packages">


import top_packages from "./plot_json/plot05_fig_top_packages.json";

<Plot id="fig-top_packages" spec={top_packages} />

Figure 5

</div>

<a href="#fig-top-packages" class="quarto-xref">Figure 5</a> shows an
absolute accumulation of all package installations over the whole time
frame present in the data.

The top packages are unsurprisingly the `base-system` and `xtools`
packages, followed by `wget`, `htop` and `rsync`.[^2]

In my opinion the list of top packages reflects the technical audience
of Void Linux and does not hold too many surprises. Almost everyone uses
`socklog` and most people have the `nonfree` repo enabled. `firefox` is
the most installed browser, and everyone at least has `alsa-utils`
installed, even if they may not be using `alsa` as their primary sound
provider.

I am somewhat surprised by the prevalence of `git`, though this package
is in turn required by many others. Among them some of the other top
packages such as `xtools`, so it does make sense.

It, along with the prevalence of `tmux` (even above `zip`!) does once
again speak to the technical nature of Void Linux users, however – at
least for those opting into data collection.

Almost everyone keeps the `base-system` package installed but,
importantly, not *everyone*. The package is not represented for each
installation, with a sizable chunk of people having removed it.

Lastly, I am also pleasantly surprised by the appearance of `gimp` in
the top 20 packages.

The ‘rarest’ 20 packages shows a random sampling of packages which have
been installed by *someone* but only that single someone. In other
words, there are quite a few packages which nobody in the sample has
installed but those are not represented here. Instead, the rare packages
tend to show those that somebody built themselves, or only tried
briefly. In a way they provide more of a snapshot of the kind of custom
shenanigans users get up to within the `xbps` packaging system, or could
be viewed as a potential ‘wishlist’ of packages not yet officially
available.

Let’s turn to the ‘distribution’ of package installations.

<div id="fig-package-distribution">


import package_distribution from "./plot_json/plot06_fig_package_distribution.json";

<Plot id="fig-package_distribution" spec={package_distribution} />

Figure 6

</div>

Visualized above is the package installation frequency (or density)
distribution. On the Y-axis we see the amount of packages while on the
X-axis we see the amount of installations. What this means is that we
see *how often* packages tend to be installed, and where the majority of
packages is grouped.[^3]

*Many* packages are installed 0 to 10 times. Some packages are installed
above 10 times, fewer yet above 100 times, and so on, and this
distribution is what we see here.

To be more precise with the numbers: There are 1,005 packages which have
between one and ten installations in the data, 538 packages between
eleven and 20 installations, and 307 packages between 21 and 30
installations. 13,745 packages have over 30 installations.

For now, these are the explorations I have done for the package data
collected. I think it is interesting to see, especially the evolution of
package installations over time, and per user, as well as getting a
glimpse of the most used packages in the sample.

But there are yet more things to explore in the statistics overall.

## Kernel Analysis

Beyond package numbers, the data also encapsulate information about the
Linux kernels used by Void Linux users. The files report the exact
kernel version users are running, including the major version, minor
versions, and any suffixes as well.

For example, there are many reports containing the `4.19.0-9-amd64`
kernel, or some containing the `6.1.53-1-lts` kernel, or
`6.11.2-asahi-6.11.2-1_4`. These are ‘extraordinary’ kernels in my
opinion, and they do not follow clear naming patterns. For the purposes
of the following visualizations any such suffixes have been cut off,
looking only at the versioning of the main kernels themselves.

Let’s start by looking at the prevalence of the different major
versions.

<div id="fig-kernel-versions">


import kernel_versions from "./plot_json/plot07_fig_kernel_versions.json";

<Plot id="fig-kernel_versions" spec={kernel_versions} />

Figure 7

</div>

This is an accumulation of the three major versions used during the
collected timeline, over the *whole* time as absolute numbers.

When looking at the kernel versions used, we see a very strong jump
between major kernel version 4 and major kernel version 5, with version
4 being significantly less prevalent in the data.

Of course, this makes sense from a release standpoint: kernel version
5.0 was released in March 2019, just a single year after the start of
data collection.[^4] Additionally, as we established above, this was
also the time of the fewest unique data reports, so the absolute amount
of kernel 4 reports is even smaller.

Kernel version 5 has just been overtaken by Kernel version 6 as the
dominant amount of reported kernel versions, but just barely. This makes
sense since major version 6.0 was released in October 2022. It has thus
been just over three years of version 5 being the latest kernel, and
almost exactly the same length of time of version 6 being the latest
kernel.

Additionally, we have to keep the curve of unique installations in mind
for absolute numbers like these: Kernel 5 was released right as the
massive increase in unique Void Linux installation reports happened, and
Kernel 6 right after the report slump happened. This, in all likelihood,
accounts for the apparent slight imbalance between the numbers, and will
shift further over the coming months.

Just like with kernel suffixes, for this analysis we also had to exclude
183 rows which were apparently from the future — as they were running
variations of major kernel version 99. In all likelihood there is a
custom compiled kernel version out there which reports its own major
version as 99. The strange version starts appearing on 2020-08-08 and
shows up all the way until 2021-03-23.

Let’s turn to the actual adoption of kernels over time in the next
visualization.

<div id="fig-kernel-timeline">


import kernel_timeline from "./plot_json/plot08_fig_kernel_timeline.json";

<Plot id="fig-kernel_timeline" spec={kernel_timeline} />

Figure 8

</div>

A timeline analysis of the prevalent kernels in the data shows that new
major kernel version are adopted relatively rapidly and with the
majority of switches occuring at roughly the same time.

This change is especially stark between major kernel versions 5 and 6,
which seem to have traded place in usage almost over night. A reasonable
speculation for this rapid switch is that the `linux` kernel
meta-package was pointed at the new version at that time, so each update
pulled the new kernel.

The first time that major version 5 of the kernel shows up is on 04 Mar
2019. From here, it took a long time for the last of the version 4
kernels to disappear. Interestingly, this roughly coincides with the big
switch between major version 5 and 6. The last time a major version 4 is
seen is on 31 Oct 2022, while the last major version 5 kernels still pop
up. It would seem, then, that the people still running kernel version 4
used the opportunity of everybody switching to the stable version of 6
to also upgrade their machines.

If we cautiously extrapolate a little from the data we have, it would
seem reasonable that the last remnants of kernel version 5 may be
disappearing around May or June 2026. A lot depends on the upstream
kernel release windows and the stability of the releases themselves of
course. But barring any major upheavals in the kernel releases (of a
magnitude like the removal of
[bcachefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcachefs)) or major stability
issues, this seems a reasonable assumption to me.

## Conclusion

That’s it for the main look at the packages and kernel versions in use
in the Void Linux community, currently and in the past.

There are of course more observations to be made. One that still
interests me is the development of the dominant packages over time —
were the top packages relatively static or did they evolve from others?

Another interesting approach would be to drill down into minor kernel
versions and custom compiled kernels, investigating their prevalence and
smaller time-frames of version changes.

Lastly, it may be of interest to look into the ‘longevity’ of individual
packages and package stats in the data. Is there an especially
long-lived package besides the usual suspects of `base-system`, `git`
and so on? Are there specific packages which were especially
short-lived? Do people generally cling to specific package versions for
a longer time than others?

These may be interesting paths of further analysis to go down, but for
me the above should suffice for now. If you want to delve into the data
yourself, links to all the code and datasets can be found at the end of
the appendix below.

It is lovely to see a somewhat broader adoption of both Void Linux and
the Popcorn reporting tool over the last years, but at the same time I
was not expecting to see such obvious dips over the years as well.

Indeed, some of the graphs still look more like ‘hype’-adoption patterns
than more slow and steady growth, which is definitely a surprise to me.

The kernel adoption pattern is more expected, yet still a nice sight to
have visualized. I already took a look at the longevity of different
kernel versions in the stats a little while ago, and encourage you to
check out the associated article [using nushell to peruse popcorn
statistics](https://martyoeh.me/blog/2025-11-20-nushell-popcorn-analysis)
if the above wasn’t enough analysis for you.

Thank you for reading, I hope you enjoyed!

## Appendix: Odds and Ends

The above graphics are the main ones that I think could be useful,
entertaining, or somewhere in between. However, when exploring data,
many more visualizations come to light. Most of them are a little more
‘boring’ than the ones selected above, but may still be of interest for
technical deep-dives or more specific investigations. They are collected
here, in my pseudo-appendix to the main article.

The following sections look at the structure of the PopCorn files, their
cumulative filesize, daily and monthly package usage, and finally trace
the missing days in the data.

### The PopCorn files

Let’s have a closer look at the provided PopCorn statistics files
themselves.

The files consist of a long list of packages which have been reported to
the central server that day, along with the number of package instances.
The amount of unique installations from which these statistics are
derived are given as a sum. It also consists of the same list once
again, but separated by specifically installed versions of packages.

So if somebody has v0.9.1 and somebody else v0.9.3 instead this list
counts the number of both packages with their versions separately.
Another count is the number of different Kernels that have been used on
that day, with their exact kernel name including major version, minor
version and any suffix.

``` json
{
  "UniqueInstalls": 2,
  "Packages": {
    "ImageMagick": 1,
    "PopCorn": 2,
    "acpi": 1,
    "alsa-utils": 2,
  ...
    "xurls": 1,
    "youtube-dl": 1
  },
  "Versions": {
    "ImageMagick": {
      "6.9.9.40_1": 1
    },
    "PopCorn": {
      "0.2_1": 2
    },
    "acpi": {
      "1.7_3": 1
    },
    "alsa-utils": {
      "1.1.5_1": 1,
      "1.1.6_1": 1
    },
  ...
  },
  "XuKernel": {
    "4.16.6_1": 1
  }
```

When grouped by the packages and aggregated over all days, this results
in a table, for example the following is the table for the package count
list:

<div id="tbl-package-counts">

Table 1

<div class="cell-output cell-output-display" execution_count="13">

<div>
<small>shape: (100, 3)</small>

| 2018-05-09 | "wifish"           | 1     |

</div>

</div>

</div>

When taking a look at the file sizes of the PopCorn report files we did
so for each day individually above. But we can also look at the
accumulative growth instead: here we just add up all the files reported
so far for each day, and show the resulting growth line.

<div id="fig-filesize-cumulative">


import filesize_cumulative from "./plot_json/plot09_fig_filesize_cumulative.json";

<Plot id="fig-filesize_cumulative" spec={filesize_cumulative} />

Figure 9

</div>

A cumulative view gives a less granular look at the individual daily
changes but provides a more macro-level view on how big the statistics
have grown to be overall. We can see that, as each individually reported
day adds up to 400KB nowadays, the cumulative size is up to almost 700MB
currently.

### Packages monthwise and per weekday

Let’s also look at the packages installed on systems for different time
slices. We’ll start with a look at the packages per weekday.

<div id="fig-weekday-packages">


import weekday_packages from "./plot_json/plot10_fig_weekday_packages.json";

<Plot id="fig-weekday_packages" spec={weekday_packages} />

Figure 10

</div>

There is no significant difference between the individual weekdays, as
we would expect. It seems strange to have a specific day on which
everybody decides to install or uninstall new packages.

That said, there is some slight variation, with Wednesdays generally
having a few fewer total packages to boast than other days, especially
Tuesdays which are slightly above the curve.

Let’s just imagine everybody gets bored on Tuesday, installs a new
package and drops it again by Wednesday, along with a slew of other
packages. Try-out Tuesdays and Wastebin Wednesdays if you will.

Alright, but let’s also take a look at the package numbers per month
instead.

<div id="fig-month-packages">


import month_packages from "./plot_json/plot11_fig_month_packages.json";

<Plot id="fig-month_packages" spec={month_packages} />

Figure 11

</div>

Here we can see a bit more variation. First it is important to note that
I have removed the first months of 2018 prior to December from the
analysis and cut off any days after November 2025, to have only full
years represented and avoid any months being present more often than
others.[^5]

It is quite surprising to me just how much variation is visible in the
results: months from October to February have markedly fewer packages
than the spring and summer months. Are people generally more willing to
use and try out new packages in the summer? Alternatively, were any of
the major usage dips taking place during winter, while the increases in
usage occured more toward summer?

I have not delved deep into the interpretation of these questions, but
it may be interesting to do so. The last option, of course, is that the
data itself, the data collection or analysis contains an error that I am
not aware of.

### Missing days and dates

There are some missing days in the statistics.

<div id="tbl-missing-days">

These missing days are primarily occuring at the end of January 2019,
and throughout 2025. However, with over 2600 days where the statistics
*are* available, these rows represent an insignificant issue for the
overall data.

It would seem there was some kind of issue collecting or storing the
collected data at that point in 2019, which means a few days in a row
are missing. This skews absolute numbers for that week downwards, as
well as any weekly averages relying on this date-range.

However, no significant visual differences stem from this fact, which is
why it is not called out in the main article. As it is — an interesting
fact, and, where this a more rigorous investigation, perhaps worthy of
taking into account as biasing the result, but for our purposes not too
bad.

### The code and the data

All the data used in the previous sections originally comes from
[https://popcorn.voidlinux.org](https://popcorn.voidlinux.org). The collected data, in csv form, is
available from [this
repository](https://git.martyoeh.me/datasci/ds-voidlinux-popcorn).

If you want to take a closer look at the functions creating the plots
and tables above, they are all available in [this
repository](https://git.martyoeh.me/datasci/analysis-voidlinux-popcorn)
in the `notebooks/popcorn.py` file. It is the first project I have
written using [marimo](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo) instead of
jupyter, and I have to say I really enjoy its workflow.

To figure out which function creates which plot, just look up the
function name in the relevant cell imported in the `popcorn.qmd` quarto
file above, and search for it in the marimo notebook file.

I assume most people reading this will be very familiar with and using
it already, but if not and any of this piques your interest, feel free
to also take [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org/) for a spin. Don’t
forget to install and enable
[PopCorn](https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/tree/master/srcpkgs/PopCorn)
so that you too can contribute to the future statistics above ;-)

[^1]: I suppose one interpretation would be people taking their 4th of
    July celebrations very seriously, and thus not being present in the
    statistics for the day after. However, I am not sure if this would
    reflect so strongly in data collection, and it additionally
    pre-supposes the data collected predominantly stemming from the
    United States. Lastly, one would suppose this having a similar
    effect every year if that was the case.

[^2]: I have removed the PopCorn package itself from the data. Funnily
    enough, since *everybody* who is represented in the data has to have
    PopCorn installed or the data wouldn’t be collected in the first
    place, if we extrapolate from the collected data naively this means
    more people have PopCorn installed than the base-system. Of course,
    viewed over the majority of Void Linux installations this is
    hogwash. We have the absolute numbers and only around 150 people
    ever have PopCorn installed. But it nicely represents some of the
    danger of over-interpreting the results before us without also
    reflecting on sample bias.

[^3]: In the package density count above, since we are accumulating over
    the absolute numbers of all installations of all users, the overall
    high numbers are really *high*, i.e. above 150,000. Since we are
    sorting the package counts into a finite number of bins to make
    visualizing it possible, the lowest bin overshoots the 0-mark and we
    get an estimation of minus-installation counts. Of course, this is
    not possible, no package in the data has been installed negative
    amount of times — to my knowledge!

[^4]: Data collection began in May 2018. All information on the kernel
    release timelines is taken from the nicely comprehensive *Linux
    Kernel Version History* [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel_version_history>).

[^5]: I chose the first couple of months in the data, rather than the
    most recent months as fewer people were collecting data, thus we
    have less of a loss. Additionally, I presume people are more
    interested in current statistics than older ones, just generally.
