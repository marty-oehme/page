For a little while now I am in the process of transferring my main daily driving machine from Archlinux to Voidlinux.

It has been a long time coming and bit-by-bit I was checking out the differences and learning about the changes needed.
After looking through the repositories and checking out which packages I would be missing from the AUR,
and learning to package my own,
I felt confident enough to make the switch.

One thing that will stand out to everybody almost instantly is the missing `systemd` dependency on void.
Some hate it, for some it is the only reason to switch --
I am at somewhat of a middle ground.

I do see the advantages of an infrastructure built around `systemd`, but I have also really grown to like the simplicity of the `runit` system that void uses.
Services work on both, user services work on both, and my system runs on both.
For now, I will hold my judgment (until I really have to delve into more complex use cases).

However, one thing `systemd` (and by extension, `elogind`) always took care of for me was figuring out what to do when closing my laptop lid:
When I have external screens connected to my machine I want it to continue on as if nothing happened;
otherwise suspend since we're not seeing anything anyway.

On my current system I use a combination of `seatd` and `turnstiled` for my login and seat management.
These come without the usual 'LidEvent=' settings that I am used to.
However, all of this can be mimicked through `acpid` as well which comes pre-installed on any Voidlinux setup.

## Idea

The ACPI daemon needs to be set up and running (`ln -s /etc/sv/acpid /var/service/`),
and handling system events (and, ideally, be the _only_ daemon handling system events).

You can check those system events using `acpi_listen` which comes along with the daemon package.
When hitting the 'mute' button on your machine (if you have one, often one of the `fn` keys on laptops),
the program will print `button/mute MUTE <numbers>`,
or e.g. `button/power PBTN` when hitting your power button.

This is what we will hook into by listening to the `button/lid` event,
and creating our own action that will be undertaken when the event is fired.

The action will still put our machine to sleep (i.e. suspend it),
but we will check for any external screens connected beforehand.

Lastly, we need to ensure that _only_ our action is undertaken and not any default suspend actions
which may still exist.

## Implementation

Let's implement this idea.
We only need two files to accomplish this --
one for our event listener and one for our action script --
both located in the `/etc/acpi` configuration directory.

However, since Voidlinux comes with a default ACPI handling script, we also need to ensure this does not fire.
Let's start with that:

There should be a `handler.sh` file located in your `/etc/acpi` dir.
It is about a hundred lines long and you need to comment out the lid handling logic.
Since (I believe) it fairly rarely changes on Voidlinux,
you can just look for lines number 74 through 86 and comment those out.

Here is what we want to end up with:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
# Default acpi script that takes an entry for all actions

# NOTE: This is a 2.6-centric script.  If you use 2.4.x, you'll have to
#       modify it to not use /sys

case "$1" in
    ...
    battery)
        ...
        ;;
    # HANDLED IN SEPARATE ACTION FILE
    button/lid) ;;
    #     case "$3" in
    #         close)
    #             # suspend-to-ram
    #             # logger "LID closed, suspending..."
    #             # zzz
    #             ;;
    #         open)
    #             logger "LID opened"
    #             ;;
    #         *)  logger "ACPI action undefined (LID): $2";;
    #     esac
    #     ;;
    video/brightnessdown)
        step_backlight -
    ...
```

The logic is found in the 'button/lid' case and I simply commented it out.
I left the case matching statement itself intact and added `;;` behind it instead,
so the event is still caught and simply has no corresponding action in the script instead of giving us an
unhandled error[^unhandled]

[^unhandled]: If we were to completely comment out catching this case, it would instead fall
back on the default case and write an undefined action to the system log. This happens since
`acpid` runs _all_ defined rules and this rule catches _all_ events, so regardless of our settings
we still run through the default handler script routine for the lid action.

Once that is done, when you close the laptop lid it will not suspend anymore.
The screen will presumably still turn off (that is not handled by the ACPI system as far as I can tell),
but no sleeping happens.

So, let's re-enable suspend but only when _we_ want it.

Create a new file in `/etc/acpi/events/`.
It can be called anything but since we are using it to catch lid events,
I call it simply `button-lid`.
It should have the following contents:

```sh
# Only pass lid events
event=button/lid
action=/etc/acpi/actions/button-lid.sh %e
```

While pretty straightforward, a quick explanation:
`event=` declares what we are listening to and could be wild-carded as well,
e.g. `event=button/*` to catch _all_ button events.

`action=` simply points out a script file which we run when the event takes place.
Additionally, we pass the event name itself along with `%e`.

Now, on to the handler script.
If the `/etc/acpi/actions` directory does not exist yet,
create it and create the `button-lid.sh` file within.[^action-location]

[^action-location]: The file could be anywhere,
next to the default handler script,
in another directory entirely -- does not matter.
To me, however, it makes sense to have one directory for event triggers and one for action outcomes.

This will be our most involved file.
It should have the following contents:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
# Specifically handling LID events
# Can take the form:
# button/lid LID close
# button/lid LID open
# We are only interested in value $3.

# Do not turn off machine if external screens are connected.

case "$3" in

close)
    should_sleep=true
    screens=$(find /sys/devices -type f -wholename '*drm/*card*-DP-*/status')
    while IFS= read -r screen; do
        if [ "$(cat "$screen")" = connected ]; then
            should_sleep=false
        fi
    done <<EOF
$screens
EOF

    if [ "$should_sleep" = true ]; then
        suspend-to-ram
        logger "LID closed, no external screens, suspending..."
        zzz
    else
        logger "LID closed, external screens, not suspending."
    fi
    ;;

open) logger "LID opened" ;;

*) logger "ACPI action undefined (LID): $*" ;;

esac
```

Similarly to the default script we check if the lid has been opened or closed.
If it's opened we only output a little message to the system log.

In the case of it closing is when our additional logic takes place:

By default we go to sleep.
Before doing so we check for any external DP-type screens having the 'connected' status
(does that stand for `Display Port`?
I never checked, but all my external screens are called `-DP-` and my internal is `-eDP-`).

If _any_ of them have the status of being 'connected',
we do not actually go to sleep.

Lastly, we output a little notification to the system log as well.

Done!

Make sure the handler file (`button-lid.sh`) is executable by doing `chmod +x /etc/acpi/actions/button-lid.sh`,
and tell `acpid` to reload its rules.
That can be accomplished by completely restarting the daemon or sending it a `SIGHUP` instead,
by doing `pkill -1 acpid`.

## Conclusion

This should set up everything for the machine to reliably go to sleep as before when nothing external is connected.
If any screens are connected, however, we inhibit suspend.

It should print on the system log that rules have been reloaded,
and next time you close your lid with external screens connected everything stays on.

Pretty neat, and by creating this little script I learned quite a bit about the ACPI system,
which I never had to deal with before.
It is quite an intuitive system with hooks for a wide variety of event types,
and as far as I can tell some of it can get quite complicated.

Ultimately (depending on how much scripting you plan on doing) it may make sense to completely
disable the default handling script and spin out all event catching to their own event-action pairs,
like we did here.

Additionally, it may make more sense to set up event handling like this through the Linux-provided
`udev` hook system which operates similarly to what we just set up but handles a wider variety of
situations and devices.
It is, for the time being, however a little too opaque for me
and I don't yet need more advanced capabilities than what ACPI can provide.

But for now, I am satisfied, and confident this system will work well for me for a long time.
