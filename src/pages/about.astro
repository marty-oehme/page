      <h3 class="text-secondary">My name is Marty Oehme.</h3>

      <p>I am a code fiddler, research helper, and open data proponent.</p>
      <p>
        I have worked with a small variety of international and academic organizations, including
        the University of Leipzig, Roskilde University, the ILO and the UN's UNU-WIDER.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it be research paths, programming challenges, data analysis or anything else, I
        strive for a methodical approach that can be openly traced, versioned, is as understandable
        and non-destructive as possible (so it can always be rolled back if necessary).
      </p>
      <p>
        Thankfully, modern text processing software, data analysis tools and programming
        environments make this task not only possible, but often times the most fruitful, productive
        and downright joyous way to accomplish this.

        However, this website is less intended as a professional overview of my activities and
        instead a playground for people to explore free and open source software, as well as for me
        to get some writing out into the world whenever such fancy strikes me.
