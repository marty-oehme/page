    <h1>{pageTitle}</h1>
    <h2>My name is Marty Oehme.</h2>

    <p>I am a code fiddler, research helper, and open data proponent.</p>
    <p>I have worked for a small variety of international and academic organizations,
        including the UN's UNU-WIDER, ILO, Roskilde University and the University of Leipzig.</p>
    <p>Whether it be programming challenges, research paths, data analysis or anything else,
        I strive for a methodical approach that can be openly traced, versioned, 
        is understandable and as non-destructive as possible 
        (so it can be rolled back if necessary).</p>
    <p>Thankfully, modern text processing software, data analysis tools and programming environments
        make this not only possible, but often times the most fruitful, productive 
        and even downright fun way to accomplish this.</p>
    <p>Find a reasonably current version of my CV <a href="#">here</a>,
        or contact me via e-mail <a href="#">here</a>.
        For other ways to get in touch, look <a href="#">here</a>.</p>

    <p>However, this website is less intended as a professional overview of my activities 
        and instead a playground for people to explore free and open source software,
        as well as for me to get some writing out into the world whenever such fancy strikes me.</p>

    <p>My digital skillset:</p>
    <ul>
        {skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}
    </ul>
</BaseLayout>

<style>
    .skill {
        color: rosybrown;
        font-weight: bold;
    }
</style>
