      <h3 class="text-secondary">My name is Marty Oehme.</h3>

      <p>I am a code fiddler, research helper, and open data proponent.</p>
      <p>
        I have worked with a small variety of international and academic
        organizations, including the University of Leipzig, Roskilde University,
        the ILO and the UN's UNU-WIDER.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it be research paths, programming challenges, data analysis or
        anything else, I strive for a methodical approach that can be openly
        traced, versioned, is as understandable and non-destructive as possible
        (so it can always be rolled back if necessary).
      </p>
      <p>
        Thankfully, modern text processing software, data analysis tools and
        programming environments make this not only possible, but often times
        the most fruitful, productive and downright joyous way to accomplish
        this.
      </p>

        However, this website is less intended as a professional overview of my
        activities and instead a playground for people to explore free and open
        source software, as well as for me to get some writing out into the
        world whenever such fancy strikes me.
